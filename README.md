PyBank and PyPoll Analysis
PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, the task is to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. A financial dataset called budget_data.csv is provided. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, the task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. A set of poll data called election_data.csv is provided. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast.
A complete list of candidates who received votes.
The percentage of votes each candidate won.
The total number of votes each candidate won.
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

Instructions for Running the Scripts
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the scripts (PyBank.py and PyPoll.py) and the respective CSV files (budget_data.csv and election_data.csv).
Run the respective Python script for the task you want to analyze:
For PyBank: python PyBank.py
For PyPoll: python PyPoll.py
The script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results in the analysis directory.
That's it! You have successfully analyzed the financial records or election data as per the given instructions.
